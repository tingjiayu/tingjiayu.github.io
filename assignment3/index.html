<!-- My idea for the overall website design is to look like a diary, with a total of five pages to browse. 
The above are the corresponding locations, and below is a short text explanation. 
The idea is to let users explore visual memories, like flipping through a scrapbook or photo journal.
Clickable buttons have been added to the left and right sides of the background to highlight the click selection function. 
I also plan to add the background music function. Users can choose to play music or mute it.
For part of the code writing, I sought the help of chatgpt
All the videos inside were shot by myself. The audio is from freesound and the ICONS are from icon8.
