        Q1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The home page design of Luni's website is simple but attractive. The
            first thing I noticed about this site was the use of 3D modeling,
            which is innovative and enhances the user's immersion experience.
            The home page is divided into four main interactive sections:
            "Studio", "Omada", "Career" and "Luni Life", each with bright colors
            and dynamic elements, and users can interact with these sections by
            clicking on them. The overall design is clear and fun, making you
            want to explore more.

        Q2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>

      <section>
        <p>
          In the process of experiencing Luni website, I first had a preliminary
          understanding of the overall structure and various sections of the
          website through the 3D model of the home page.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I clicked on the "Omada" page and got an in-depth look at their main
            games, including their features, positioning, and user value.
          </li>
          <li>
            I went into the "Studio" section to learn about the other products
            they were working on and to see the creative ideas of the team
            behind them.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the "Career" page, I checked the job postings and felt that they
            attach importance to creativity and works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I checked the "Luni Life" section to learn more about the
            company's internal culture, working environment and team atmosphere,
            which gave me a clearer sense of Luni's overall brand image.
          </li>
          <li>After all the browsing, I went back to the home page.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>
        Q4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the whole experience, my most common action is to slide the page
            to the top after browsing part of the content, click the "cross"
            button in the upper right corner to exit the current module and
            return to the initial state of the page. Then, I will continue the
            experience by clicking on the navigation bar in the lower right
            corner and selecting other sections.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>
        Q5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I think the main purpose of this website is to showcase the Luni
            brand and let more users know about the brand and the team. Attract
            the attention of more potential users by providing 3D models and
            interesting interaction design. Make the overall user experience
            more comfortable and smooth.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>
        Q6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The main goal of the Luni website is to show and promote the
            product, so that more people can learn about the brand and the team.
            Through 3D modeling and interesting interactive experience, it
            attracts users' attention and has a closer exploration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The website has a simple navigation, which is fixed in the lower
            right corner of the page, to help users quickly switch between
            different sections and understand the core content of the company.
            At the same time, the whole layout is simple and orderly. Users only
            need to click to enter the module they are interested in, browse the
            detailed information, and then click "exit" to return to the initial
            interface, and switch to other plates freely. This intuitive
            interaction enables users to have a more complete and clear
            understanding of Luni in a relatively short time.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>
        Q7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After the experience, I think this site is more inclined to
            short-term participation design. Its main function is to intuitively
            introduce and display the brand, products and team, and play a role
            in publicity and promotion. The website quickly conveys the core
            information of Luni through beautiful visual effects and simple
            structure, so it is more suitable for users to get to know in a
            short time. As a whole, it's not designed to keep users scrolling
            through the content over and over again, but rather to attract the
            attention of potential users or job seekers through one-off
            impressions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h3>
        Q8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Luni website is similar to the tourist mode that does not require
            login, so that users can enter the website and learn about it in the
            shortest time, improving the efficiency of the first visit, and
            there is no need to waste time on registration and login, so as to
            avoid losing some potential users. This is also in line with the
            site's goal to quickly showcase brands and products, ensuring that
            users can get key information in the shortest possible time. I think
            some of the more long-term use and multiple visits will be on their
            product games.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h3>
        Q9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Luni as a product display and promotion website, the style is closer
            to the product manual, in the most concise and clear way to
            introduce users to their product team and concept, users can quickly
            get the content they need.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            At the same time, it is also similar to the form of "scenic guide
            manual" - the home page is like a map, which presents the main
            sections at a glance, and users can independently plan the browsing
            order according to their personal interests, and freely switch
            modules to explore. This free browsing makes the entire interactive
            experience easier and more intuitive.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h3>
        Q10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I think the layout of the Luni website is somewhat similar to that
            of product manuals and guidebooks, which guide users to explore in
            an orderly, modular manner, much like a person reading a product
            manual or viewing a map of an attraction would look at the
            highlights item by item.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            When users enter the site, they will see a 3D layout similar to the
            "guide map", with four main sections (Studio, Omada, Career, Luni
            Life). This design encourages the user to click on the section of
            interest, view the content in turn, and quickly get to the key
            information.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h3>
        Q11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Luni website by combining the visual style of product brochures and
            3D interactive models, so that users can create a new and bright
            feeling when entering the website. This design allows users to feel
            a relaxed atmosphere while browsing. Different from boring
            traditional corporate websites, Luni's interaction design is more
            creative and dynamic, guiding users to participate in the experience
            with a curious mind. Users do not need to seriously "learn" the
            content of the site, but like leafing through an interactive manual,
            happily learn about brands and products.
          </li>

      <h3>
        Q12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
        what makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For me, the most frustrating part of the interactive experience is
            that when visiting the homepage for the first time, it is difficult
            to understand exactly what the core purpose of the website is trying
            to convey. The front page is dominated by 3D models, which, while
            innovative, does not clearly convey that this is a website about
            product and brand display. When first browsing, I even mistook it
            for a home or lifestyle related platform. It would be much better if
            the sections were more clearly differentiated or if there was a
            short text introduction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, during the actual browsing process, I also encountered
            some buttons could not be clicked, which made the website lack of
            interactive content, but also let me feel some regret.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h3>
        Q13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For me, the most satisfying part of the interactive experience was
            the 3D modeling used on the site, the way it interacted, and the
            overall color mix. These elements were the first highlights I was
            attracted to when I entered the site. Through the form of dioramas
            and dynamic interaction, Luni makes product promotion more vivid and
            not boring, adding a lot of surprises to the entire browsing
            process. Users acquire information while maintaining an interest in
            continuous exploration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In addition, the color of the website is fresh and layered, and the
            overall visual experience is relaxed, professional and modern.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            At the same time, the navigation is also very clear, users can
            quickly locate the section of interest, smoothly switch between the
            modules to browse.
